## GPS TOLL-BASED SYSTEM SIMULATION USING PYTHON

## Introduction

This project simulates a GPS-based toll collection system for vehicles. The system collects and stores real-time data, including vehicle information, journey details and payment status for tolls. The project is implemented in Python and uses a structured approach to manage and process vehicle data efficiently.

## Features

- **Real-time data collection**: Tracks vehicle journey in real-time.
- **Data Storage**: Stores vehicle data such as vehicle number, type, start and end points,balance, journey date, and payment status.
- **User Management**: Associates vehicle details with user IDs and extract relevant information when a journey starts.
- **Toll Payment Status**: Manages and updates the payment status for each journey.
